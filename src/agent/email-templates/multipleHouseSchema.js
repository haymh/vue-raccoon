    info: 'I represent my clients with care, confidentiality and the utmost attention to service. As a Los Angeles native with over 15 years of diverse real estate and mortgage experience, I have a deep knowledge and love of the city. Not only do I understand the importance of finding the right home, but also the right schools, community and neighborhood. I make sure to explain the real estate contract and how we can use it to protect clients during the transaction. And it’s my priority to keep my clients fully informed throughout the process; therefore I make myself easily accessible at all times. As a licensed realtor and mortgage broker, I’ve closed many difficult real estate transactions made possible only by properly configuring the contract in conjunction with the loan. My experience overcoming these hurdles helps me to understand how to negotiate the best possible deal for my clients, whether they are buyers or sellers.',
